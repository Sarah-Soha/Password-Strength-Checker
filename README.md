A beginner-friendly Python program that checks the strength of a user's password based on length, character types, and use of symbols.

# Features

- Checks if the password contains:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Digits
  - Symbols (e.g. !, @, #)
- Rates password strength as:
  - **Weak**

- ✅ Minimum length of 8 characters
- ✅ Contains at least one uppercase letter
